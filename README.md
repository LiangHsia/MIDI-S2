# MIDI-S2
Based on musegan, the midi-sandwiches 2 code is extensively reconstructed based on keras framework.

The dataset and runtime framework uses musegan, https://github.com/salu133445/musegan

After musegan's environment is set up

Running midi-sandwich starts by covering musegan with all the source code from /src.

Then run [./scripts/run_train.sh "./exp/my_experiment/" "0"] in the root directory 

Code consolidation is under way.

Detailed English notes will be added after the paper is accepted.
