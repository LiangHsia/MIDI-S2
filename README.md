# MIDI-S2
Based on MuseGAN, the MIDI-Sandwich2 code is extensively reconstructed based on keras framework.

The dataset and runtime framework uses musegan, https://github.com/salu133445/musegan

After MuseGAN's environment is set up

Running MIDI-Sandwich2 starts by covering MuseGAN with all the source code from /src.

Then run [./scripts/run_train.sh "./exp/my_experiment/" "0"] in the root directory 

Code consolidation is under way.

Detailed English notes will be added after the paper is accepted.
