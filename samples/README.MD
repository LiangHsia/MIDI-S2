best_samples_from_musegan.mp3 is best samples of MuseGAN, from https://salu133445.github.io/musegan/results

song1_from_generator.mid is generation from MIDI-Sandwich2 generator, No cherry-picking. 
Some might sound unpleasant. Lower the volume first!

song1_from_reducer.mid and song2_from_reducer.mid is generation from MIDI-Sandwich2 reducer, No cherry-picking.

Failed work (not multimodal).mid is generation without using multi-modal fusion generation.



As a result, our MIDI-Sandwich2 would generate multitrack music, but it would still be a bit less efficient than MuseGAN.

However, the effect of music generated by MIDI-Sandwich2 VAE's reductor was slightly better than that generated by MuseGAN.

Instead of using the products of multimodal VAE, it is obvious that the orbitals interfere with each other and confuse each other.
